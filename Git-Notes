GIT
 Repository is a bunch of files and folders (and these are cloned into version control 

$ = the following is a command 
$ git checkout  
$ git branch lists the branches

$ git clone  <…..rescache>
(Creates local copy / working directory)

$ git checkout -b  <branch-name> (create and checkout new branch with name specified) 
(….makes the changes)

$ git status (state of local copy)
   M…. file name (modified)
   A…. (added)
   D…. (deleted)

Origin - The repository you have cloned on your computer 
Remote Repository - A repository that’s not on your computer

Then ADD changes to get them to commit 
$ git add <filenames>
OR 
$ git add .

Then COMMIT 
(Kind of like a bookmark. While working everything looks good here, and allows you to go back to the version saved at that time) 

$ git commit -m “remove references to rescal from yams”
-m means message

Then PUSH changes (to remote repository) 

$ git pull - gets all the changes from the origin repo and updates local copy 

Touch command check to see if there is a file, if there isn’t it will create it

Can change file name
mv notes Notes
